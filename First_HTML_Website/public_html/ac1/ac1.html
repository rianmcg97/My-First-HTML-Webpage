            Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad (1165–1257) meaning "The Flying Eagle, Son of Nobody", was born to a Syrian-Muslim father,<br>
            Umar Ibn-La'Ahad, and his wife, Maud, who died of complications during childbirth. <br>
            As the years passed, Altaïr grew to be a skilled Assassin, but was very arrogant. He once led the retaking of Masyaf after Al Mualim,<br> 
            <img id="apple" src="../ac1/images/apple_of_eden.png" alt="">
            the mentor of the Order, was captured, which earned him the respect of his fellow Assassins.
            He was then sent on a mission to<br>
            Solomon's Temple to recover a hidden artifact. The mission was a failure as Altaïr broke the tenets of the Order<br>
            and left his fellow Assassins to face the Templars alone after he was thrown from the room by Robert de Sablé.<br>
            Altaïr fled to Masyaf to report his failure but was followed, resulting in Masyaf being attacked by the Templars.<br>
            The Assassins were able to fend off their enemies, but Altaïr was punished by being stabbed by Al-Mualim. Altaïr later awoke and <br>
            discovered that he had been stripped of his rank, but was told by Al-Mualim that he would be able to recover it if he could kill<br>
            nine Templars in the Holy Land. Altaïr was able to assassinate the first eight and discovered that his last target was Robert<br>
            himself. He made his way back to Jerusalem where he met Robert. However, as he removed the helmet of the Templar,<br>
            he found out that he had not faced Robert but a girl. He allowed her to live and she told him that Robert<br>
            had made his way to Arsuf. Altaïr followed and finally killed Robert, who revealed that Al Mualim was actually using<br>
            Altaïr to obtain the Apple of Eden, a powerful artifact left behind by the First Civillization. Altaïr returned to <br>
            Masyaf,where Al Mualim confirmed what Robert had said. Altaïr, aided by a number of other Assassins,<br>
            fought his way to Al Mualim, who had used to the artifact from Solomon's Temple to enslave the people of<br>
            Masyaf. Altaïr and his mentor battled each other and Altaïr finally killed him, taking his place as mentor.<br>
