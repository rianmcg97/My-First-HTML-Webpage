            Ezio Auditore  was born into the nobility on June 24, 1459, in the Italian city of Florence. Ezio's family were <br>
            the victims of an evil plot that ultimately took the lives of his father, Giovanni, and two brothers, Federico<br>
            and Petruccio. Of the Auditore men, only Ezio was able to escape because their capture occurred whilst Ezio <br>
            was running errands for his father. Through Ezio's help however, both his mother and younger sister <br>
            managed to survive, finding a way to escape the city with him.<br>
            According to the Florentine Guard's record books, Ezio appeared as a womanizer, with guards rarely able 
            to capture him.<br>
            <img id="borgia" src="../ac2/images/rodrigo_borgia.png" alt="">
            Ezio, following his father Giovanni's final advice, finds his father's Assassin tools and flees the city<br>
            with his mother and sister to the safety of his uncle Mario's villa in the countryside. Mario assists Ezio<br>
            in discovering the people behind the conspiracy, the search leading Ezio from Florence, to<br>
            San Gimignano, Forlì, Venice, and eventually to Rome. As he identifies and assassinates more and more<br>
            political figures, Ezio also gains several allies, including Niccolò Machiavelli and Leonardo da Vinci,<br>            
            the latter of whom helps Ezio improve his equipment using schematics found in Altaïr's Codex pages.<br>
            These allies train Ezio into an Assassin and guide him on his quest. Eventually, the conspiracy leads to<br>
            the mastermind of the plot: "the Spaniard" Rodrigo Borgia, Grand master of the Italian Templars.<br>
            He sought to find the Apple—a Piece of Eden—which lay in Florence. Ezio finds Borgia in <br>
            possession of the Apple that Altaïr had recovered centuries ago and learns that Borgia believes<br>
            himself to be "the Prophet" that will lead the Templars to the fabled "Vault". Ezio is able to <br>
            confront Borgia with the help of his allies and recover the Apple, but Borgia flees before he can<br>
            be killed. Ezio's allies reveal they are all Assassins and believe Ezio to be the true Prophet,<br>
            allowing him to join their ranks.
